Rust Miner is a simple, console-based tycoon game, built as a practice project for learning Rust programming!

How to play:

First, you'll need to copy the repository to your local system, navigate to the root directory "rust-miner" & run "cargo run" in your terminal.
- 'mine' command: Typing 'mine' into the console will collect between 1-3 iron ore, & save it to your game state for that session
- 'sell' command: Typing 'sell' into the console will trade your collected iron ore for money. You must have atleast 5 iron to sell, each iron ore is worth $3
- 'help' command: Typing 'help' into the console will display your command options to the console.
- 'quit' command: Typing 'quit' into the console will exit the game, currently does not save progress

IN PROGRESS

Currently working on being able to purchase efficiency boosters with money, be able to save your game & resume, as well as adding other functionality to the game based on user feedback.
